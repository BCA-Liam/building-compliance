        <h1>Air Tightness Testing</h1>

        <p>
            Air Tightness Testing (also known as air permeability testing or air leakage testing) is a crucial part 
            of building compliance in the UK. It measures how much air escapes from a building through uncontrolled 
            leaks in the fabric of the building envelope.
        </p>

        <p><strong>✅ Why It’s Required</strong><br>
        Part L of the Building Regulations (England & Wales) mandates air tightness testing for new dwellings and 
        commercial buildings. It's essential to demonstrate energy efficiency by limiting heat loss through air leakage.</p>

        <p><strong>🏠 What It Involves</strong><br>
        A blower door test is carried out: a fan is temporarily installed in a doorway to pressurise or depressurise the 
        building. Sensors measure the rate of airflow required to maintain pressure, revealing how ‘leaky’ the building is. 
        Test results are given in m³/h·m² @ 50Pa (cubic metres per hour per square metre at 50 pascals of pressure).</p>

        <p><strong>📉 Benefits</strong><br>
        • Reduces heating and cooling costs<br>
        • Improves occupant comfort<br>
        • Enhances building durability<br>
        • Helps meet SAP/SBEM and EPC targets</p>

        <p><strong>🧱 Who Needs It?</strong><br>
        • New build houses and flats<br>
        • Commercial properties over 500m²<br>
        • Extensions or refurbishments depending on compliance route</p>

        <p><strong>🛠️ Preparation Tips</strong><br>
        • Seal all intentional openings (vents, extractor fans)<br>
        • Ensure doors and windows are properly installed<br>
        • Check for gaps in skirting, pipe penetrations, etc.</p>
