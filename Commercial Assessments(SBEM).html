        <h1>Commercial Assessments (SBEM)</h1>

        <p>
            The Simplified Building Energy Model (SBEM) is the UK government’s approved calculation method
            for assessing the energy performance of non-domestic buildings. SBEM assessments are essential for
            demonstrating compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations for commercial and public buildings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our qualified assessors deliver precise SBEM calculations and reports, providing detailed insights
            into your building’s energy efficiency and carbon emissions. Whether you’re designing offices, retail
            spaces, or industrial facilities, our SBEM services help you meet regulatory standards and improve
            sustainability performance.
