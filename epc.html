        <h1>EPC (Energy Performance Certificate)</h1>
        <p><strong>An EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) is an official document that rates the energy efficiency of a building in the UK. It’s a legal requirement when a property is built, sold, or rented.</strong><br><p>



<p><strong>🔍 What Does an EPC Show?</strong><br>
<p><strong></strong> Efficiency Rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient)</strong><br

<p><strong></strong> energy costs for lighting, heating, and hot water</strong><br>

<p><strong></strong> How to improve energy performance</strong><br>

<p><strong></strong>Carbon emissions data</strong><br>

<p><strong>🏡 Who Needs an EPC?</strong><br>
Homeowners selling or renting their property

Landlords of residential and commercial properties

Developers of new builds (EPC is based on SAP or SBEM calculations)</strong><br>

<p><strong>📜 How Long Is It Valid?</strong><br>
An EPC is valid for 10 years

<p><strong>🛠️ How Is It Produced?</strong><br>
A qualified Domestic or Non-Domestic Energy Assessor visits the property

They assess insulation, heating systems, ventilation, glazing, and other features

For new buildings, it's based on design-stage calculations (SAP or SBEM) followed by an As-Built EPC

<p><strong>✅ Why Is It Important?</strong><br>
Legal compliance

Informs buyers and tenants of energy costs

Can improve sale/rental value

Supports sustainability and net-zero goals</p>
