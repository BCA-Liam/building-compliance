    <h1>Part G Water Calculations</h1>

    <p>
      Part G of the UK Building Regulations sets standards for sanitation,
      hot water safety, and water efficiency in buildings. Water calculations
      under Part G assess the estimated water consumption of a building to ensure
      compliance with efficiency requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our experienced assessors perform accurate Part G water calculations to help you
      design buildings that conserve water and meet regulatory standards.
      By optimizing water use, we support sustainable building practices
      and contribute to reducing environmental impact.
